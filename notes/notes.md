At each information set in the game tree, the algorithm keeps a counter of regret values for each possible action. The regret means how much better the agent would have done if it had always played that action rather than the actual strategy that could be a mixture of actions. Positive regret means we should have taken that action more and negative regret means we would have done better by not taking that action.
